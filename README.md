### Scripts that I found, modified or made myself.

What each script is:
* **guess.bash** is number guessing game made in bash to get my familiar with bash scripting.
* **colortrans** is a script that finds the closest xterm-256 color from a hex color in python2
* **drawAterminal** from a fellow redditor u/Matrix8910 
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/9t2p1b/bspwm_found_this_while_browsing_old_backup/e8tdi0r/) 
needs [slop](https://github.com/naelstrof/slop) to work and a terminal that accept window dimensions through 
an argument.
* **snowjob** stollen from https://gist.github.com/sontek/1505483
* ogg-cover-art stollen from https://github.com/acabal/scripts/blob/master/ogg-cover-art it's a script that helps you add cover images to .ogg files.
* _to be continued..._
